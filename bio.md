What I did before this bootcamp? Before this bootcamp, I worked at Northgate Chrysler as a car salesman. As much as I loved the people whom I worked with, the job really wasn't challenging and the pay was high risk. I needed something stable, and Technology is definitely my Niche.
What brought me to this bootcamp? I started on FreeCodeCamp dabbling here and there in html amd Css before i realized that this really interested me, also the show Mr. Robot showed me a side of code writing that felt godlike. Dave contacted me on LinkedIn and i never looked back.
My feelings about being a professional software developer? I'm looking very forward to it. So excited.
